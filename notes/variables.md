# VARIABLES

Variables are used to store and to point to thing in memory

Ex: Algebra
``` js
x=15

x+5=?//20

```

In JS all variables must have `unique names` 

### Rules for Naming
-Names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dollors signs
-Names MUST begin with letters.
-Names can begin with a dollor sign or underscore (not really used)
-Names are CASE sensitive (x and X they are different)
-Reserve words CANNOT be used (class, let, const, var)
